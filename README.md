# DSVIL GitHub Web Activity

This activity introduces the GitHub web interface and simple ways to navigate and contribute to a project. The workshop leaders will walk through the activity once as an example. The majority of the time is for exploration and experimentation. Workshop leaders and other experienced colleagues are available to help and answer questions.
